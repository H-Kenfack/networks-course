## Course description
Networks represent data by describing a set of objects and the relations between them. Networks are ubiquitous in many fields of science; for example, they have been used to represent include social interactions, relationships between genes or protein sequences, and the connectivity of neurons in the brain. This project-based course will introduce students to the process of analyzing real-world network data in Python. Topics covered will include network representations, centrality and ranking measures, modularity and community detection, network embeddings, random graph models, graph matching, network hypothesis testing, and graph neural networks. Students will be expected to submit a very brief analysis (in Python) of some real-world network dataset for their final project. Familiarity with Python, statistics and linear algebra is very highly encouraged.

## Prerequisites
The following prerequisites are highly recommended to take this course. Please talk to 
the instructor if you are unsure about your prior knowledge for any of these:
- Python programming experience 
- Linear algebra 
- Probability/statistics

## Topics
For specific topics covered, please see the [calendar page](page:calendar).

## Materials
### Code/software
#### Primary
- [graspologic](https://graspologic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/)
- [Scipy's sparse graph routines](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/sparse.csgraph.html)

#### Also mentioned 
- graph-tool
- scikit-network
- python-igraph
- karateclub
- DGL
- pytorch-geometric
- stellargraph

### Books
The following books may be useful material during the course, but none of them are
required to rent or buy:
- Networks by Mark Newman
- Atlas for the Aspiring Network Scientist
- Hands-on book by NeuroData group
- https://staging.distill.pub/2021/gnn-intro/

## Grading
To pass, a student must: 
- Attend and engage with most lectures (please let the instructor know if you need to miss a lecture for some reason)
- Submit a merge-able final project by 12pm (noon) on Jan 20th (Thursday)
- Present their final project on the last day of class

## Sick policy
My #1 priority is making sure everyone has a safe environment to learn - to this end, and out of respect
for your peers and the instructor, PLEASE do not attend in person class if you are at all sick. 
Missing class for an illness will never be held against you, please just let me know what
is going on and we will come up with a plan. 

## Final project


## Office hours
By appointment. I also expect most lecture days to have a significant group work proportion
where you can ask questions.

## Python development
Please see [insert link] for tips on getting an environment set up for Python and open source.
