## Course description
Networks represent data by describing a set of objects and the relations between them. Networks are ubiquitous in many fields of science; for example, they have been used to represent include social interactions, relationships between genes or protein sequences, and the interconnectivity of neurons in the brain. This project-based course will introduce students to the process of analyzing real-world network data in Python. Topics covered will include network representations, centrality and ranking measures, modularity and community detection, network embeddings, random graph models, graph matching, network hypothesis testing, and graph neural networks. Students will be expected to submit a very brief analysis of some real-world network dataset for their final project. Some familiarity with Python, statistics and linear algebra is highly encouraged.

## Topics
- What is a network?
- Why should we care about networks?
- How do we represent networks?
- Centrality measures (e.g. PageRank)
- Modularity maximization and community detection
- Ranking/flow (e.g. MVR, SpringRank, signal flow, etc.) 
- Unsupervised network embedding
   - Spectral embedding, min-flow-max-cut
   - Node2vec and other...
